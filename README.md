Sense, collect, visualize and change your energy- and water consumption and the amount of waste you produce!

The 'Save-O-Meter' project is a citizen science initiative by Achim Friedland, Melanie Nobis and Ricardo O’Nascimiento created during the [In/Visible Cities: Prototyping Lab](http://www.transmediale.de/content/invisible-cities-2015-prototyping-lab) as part of the [Transmediale 2015](http://www.transmediale.de). It will be a workshop with citizens in Dortmund and Jena, who are interested in their environment and technology.

In collaboration with the participants of the workshop, the three artists will develop an interactive Open Data lamp, to visualize at least the energy and water consumption, as well as the amount of waste produced in a household compared to public Open Data of the utility companies and other participants' data. The artists want their installation to be used as an interactive tool, to put in evidence that each and everyone can contribute to a sustainable and resource-friendly development of his city. Besides building the monitoring tool, learning about electronics and Open Data, the workshop serves to gather and discuss ideas around this issues. And maybe we can all witness the outcome reflected on the 'Save-O-Meter’s' glowing scale on the very next evening.

Additionally, the concrete data will be visualized on the Open Data website [Offenes Jena](http://offenes-jena.de), where the savers can also interact with each other.
